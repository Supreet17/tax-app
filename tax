i want you to do this now

create two tabs - salary split & Tax inputs

in salary split tab - add general salary splits that exist in india like - Basic pay, HRA, Special allowance - essentially look at the general splits on how indian offer letters look like and have all of these components

in the second tab - add Tax details - all relevant tax splits like - HRA, ELSS, Health insurance etc., and group them in major buckets like 80c 80d etc., read on this online - also have max that they can claim in the text below the box

now when somebody fills all of this - have two boxes like you already did on tax in new regime and tax in old regime and also have in hand salary per month

please note - if salary has components like LTA, year end bonus and PF

show in hand salary - add money added to PF every month, year end bonus value after tax

please ensure that you do calculations after reading through about this and how these calculations work !
